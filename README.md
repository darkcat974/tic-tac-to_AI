# 🎮 Tic-Tac-Toe AI

A classic Tic-Tac-Toe game with an unbeatable AI opponent! Challenge yourself against an intelligent AI that’s built to play optimally, or play with a friend!

## 🚀 Features
- **🤖 AI Opponent**: Play against an AI powered by the Minimax algorithm, designed to make perfect moves.
- **👫 Two-Player Mode**: Invite a friend to play a quick game.
- **💡 Unbeatable Strategy**: The AI is unbeatable; every move is calculated to prevent you from winning.

## 🛠️ Getting Started
**Follow these simple steps to start your game:**

- Clone the Repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/darkcat974/tic-tac-toe_AI.git
cd tic-tac-toe-ai
```

- Run the Game:
```bash
python tic_tac_toe.py [s|p|v]
```

## 🧠 How It Works
The AI uses the Minimax Algorithm, a recursive algorithm designed to explore all possible game states and determine the optimal move. Here’s a breakdown of the process:

Simulate Moves: The AI checks every potential move.
Evaluate Outcomes: It calculates the best move by minimizing your chances of winning.
Make Optimal Move: The AI selects the move that will lead to either a win or a draw.
The result? An opponent that’s practically impossible to beat!

## 📂 Project Structure
- tic_tac_toe.py — Main game logic (for Python version)
- opponent_ai.py — AI logic implementing Heuristic-Based AI
- player_ai.py — AI logic implementing Minimax

## 🎲 How to Play
AI vs AI; watch and learn (spoilers: only tie)
Player vs. AI: Choose a cell to make your move, and watch the AI respond.
Player vs. Player: Each player takes turns selecting cells until one wins or it’s a draw!

Enjoy playing the game and beating (or trying to beat) the AI! 😊
